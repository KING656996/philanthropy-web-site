       </p><h3> Angelina Jolie is famous for her acting skills and work as a filmmaker, but she is also well known for her passionate humanitarian work. 
          Not only has the 42-year-old visited several war-torn countries and refugee camps all around the world, but she even created her own organization with ex-husband Brad Pitt, the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, to aid causes close to her heart. 
          She also set up the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation after she adopted her eldest son Maddox from Cambodia to help end poverty and establish healthcare and education opportunities in the country.
           We could all learn a thing or two from Angelina's charitable heart.</h3>

      </p><li> The beginning of Angelina Jolie Charity Work  : </li>
        While Jolie was shooting for Tomb Raider in Cambodia she realized the need for humanitarian activities throughout the world.
         She contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is responsible for the protection and resolution of the problems of refugees around the world,
          to understand the places which are in extreme need of compassion.
        
        Jolie is on the mission of protecting the refugees since 2001 and in more than 20 countries like Cambodia, Thailand, Kenya Namibia etc.
         she even relocated the people. We all knew how an earthquake hit Haiti recently and took a huge toll of life. 
         She did not hesitate to visit the place and offered a helping hand to the survivors of the calamity.     
         She named her charity Jolie-Pitt Foundation and offered their services to eliminate extreme poverty and spread awareness to protect natural resources and wild life.
          The foundation donated 1 million dollars to a charity organization named Doctors without Boundaries, which helps people who are affected by violence, disaster, military battle, epidemics, malnutrition etc.
           in about 60 countries, to attend the emergency needs of the earthquake hit Haiti. According to the tax documents the Jolie and Pitt have donated about 8 million dollars for charity alone in 2006.


When asked about why she is so moved by the refugees that she even relocated so many of them, she says that the refugees should be admired for their courage to withstand such situations and should not be looked down.
 Such is her compassion towards humanity.  
 <li> She Fights for Orphaned and Abandoned Children : </li>
 Jolie has been an ambassador of SOS Children’s Villages, which focuses on protecting the interests and rights of orphaned and abandoned kids, for several years.
  As part of her work with the organization, the Girl, Interrupted star has visited many of the charity’s international outposts in Haiti, Jordan, Ethiopia, and more <br>
 
<h2> In the past, Jolie has said she loves working with SOS because she has  &lt;&lt; seen that the children are growing up in a safe and loving environment.  &gt;&gt;</h2>
 <li> She Gives Back Through Fashion </li>
As a movie star, Jolie is no stranger to jewels, so it’s no surprise that she’s even found a way to use them to make the world a better place.

The Style of Jolie, a collaborative jewelry collection from Jolie and designer ​Robert Procop, was launched in 2012 to benefit a charity co-founded by Jolie called The Education Partnership for Children of Conflict.
 The purpose of this charity is to build schools and provide education for children in areas of devastating conflicts and high refugee concentrations. 

Both Procop and Jolie have pledged to donate 100 percent of the Style of Jolie profits to the charity, which by 2013 had already built a primary school in Afghanistan. <br>
<h2>&lt;&lt; Beyond enjoying the artistic satisfaction of designing these jewels, we are inspired by knowing our work is also serving the mutual goal of providing for children in need. &gt;&gt;  Jolie said in a statement in 2013.</h2>
